I enjoy creating useful things, bringing ideas to life, and turning sometimes unclear needs into clear, functional, and enjoyable applications. What drives me every day is not just writing code, but building experiences that truly make sense.",
        "description2": "I started coding out of curiosity, and that curiosity has never left me. I like understanding how things work, exploring new technologies, and constantly improving the way I build products. Whether it’s a user interface, business logic, or overall architecture, I take the time to think, test, and iterate until I’m proud of the result. Over the years, I’ve become versatile, working across front-end, back-end, web, and mobile projects.",
        "description3": "Outside of coding, I’m involved in personal and community projects, especially in sports. These experiences have taught me essential values such as teamwork, discipline, and perseverance. They strongly influence the way I work: I enjoy building things together, sharing knowledge, and creating long-term solutions.",
